# Weather Dashboard

## Application Info

Weather Dashboard is a simple in-browser app that allows a user to find forecast information for any searched city. A user can search for a city's forecast by its name in the search field, and be shown its current weather forecast, along with the future 5-day forecast. Weather icons make quick work of identifying whether it will be clear, cloudy, rainy, etc. Search history is saved for quick recall, and a "Clear History" button is available to clear recent searches.

### Features

- Get the current forecast for that city including:
    - Temperature
    - Wind Speed
    - Humidity Level (%)
    - UV Index
    - Weather Condition Icon
- UV Index color coded based on favorable, moderate, or severe levels, according to the U.S. EPA websites UV Index
- Get the future 5-day forecast for that city
- Searched cities are locally stored and displayed as buttons to allow the user to quickly find it's forecast again
